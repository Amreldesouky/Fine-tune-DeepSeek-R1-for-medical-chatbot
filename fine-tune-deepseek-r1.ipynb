Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the patient has a history of involuntary urine loss during activities like coughing or sneezing, but she doesn't leak at night. That makes me think of stress urinary incontinence. Usually, that's caused by weak pelvic floor muscles or urethral issues, which can be triggered by activities that increase abdominal pressure.\n\nShe underwent a gynecological exam and a Q-tip test. The Q-tip test is used to check for urethral obstruction. If the test is positive, it means the urethra is blocked, and it's common in women with intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD), where the sphincter muscle doesn't properly close.\n\nSo, if the Q-tip test is positive, that suggests there's some obstruction. Now, thinking about cystometry, which is used to assess things like residual volume and detrusor contractions. Residual volume is the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination. If it's high, it might indicate that the bladder isn't emptying completely.\n\nDetrusor contractions are the contractions of the bladder muscle. If they're weak or ineffective, the bladder doesn't empty properly, leading to issues like incontinence. In cases of ISD, the detrusor contractions are usually normal, but the sphincter doesn't open properly, so the bladder doesn't empty.\n\nPutting it all together: the Q-tip test being positive points towards ISD. Cystometry would likely show normal detrusor contractions because the muscle is working, but the issue is with the sphincter not opening. The residual volume might be normal or slightly increased if the bladder isn't emptying completely despite normal contractions.\n\nI think that's the logical chain here. The key points are the Q-tip result indicating ISD and how that affects both the detrusor contractions and residual volume during cystometry.\n</think>\n\nCystometry for this 61-year-old woman would most likely reveal normal detrusor contractions and possibly an elevated residual volume. The Q-tip test indicating a positive result suggests intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD), where the sphincter muscle fails to close properly. This leads to weak or ineffective detrusor contractions, which are typically normal in ISD cases. The residual volume may be elevated due to incomplete bladder emptying, despite normal contractions, as the sphincter obstruction prevents complete voiding.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":11},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Updated training prompt style to add </think> tag \ntrain_prompt_style = \"\"\"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. \nWrite a response that appropriately completes the request. \nBefore answering, think carefully about the question and create a step-by-step chain of thoughts to ensure a logical and accurate response.\n\n### Instruction:\nYou are a medical expert with advanced knowledge in clinical reasoning, diagnostics, and treatment planning. \nPlease answer the following medical question. \n\n### Question:\n{}\n\n### Response:\n<think>\n{}\n</think>\n{}\"\"\"\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-19T03:08:16.949028Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-19T03:08:16.949857Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-19T03:08:16.954232Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-19T03:08:16.949833Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-19T03:08:16.953519Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":12},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Download the dataset using Hugging Face — function imported using from datasets import load_dataset\ndataset = load_dataset(\"FreedomIntelligence/medical-o1-reasoning-SFT\",\"en\", split = \"train[0:500]\",trust_remote_code=True) # Keep only first 500 rows\ndataset","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-19T03:08:48.716036Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-19T03:08:48.716757Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-19T03:08:51.861164Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-19T03:08:48.716734Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-19T03:08:51.860602Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"README.md:   0%|          | 0.00/1.65k [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"8ffab328fa784c4c913d2241acf6a6fd"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"medical_o1_sft.json:   0%|          | 0.00/74.1M [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"38ade326db124320b52b120bf2c18062"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Generating train split:   0%|          | 0/25371 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"9a616cce85d44b4296b6ad1b423e3790"}},"metadata":{}},{"execution_count":14,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"Dataset({\n    features: ['Question', 'Complex_CoT', 'Response'],\n    num_rows: 500\n})"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":14},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Show an entry from the dataset\ndataset[1]","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-19T03:09:10.932656Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-19T03:09:10.932923Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-19T03:09:10.941622Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-19T03:09:10.932907Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-19T03:09:10.941007Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":15,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"{'Question': 'A 45-year-old man with a history of alcohol use, who has been abstinent for the past 10 years, presents with sudden onset dysarthria, shuffling gait, and intention tremors. Given this clinical presentation and history, what is the most likely diagnosis?',\n 'Complex_CoT': \"Alright, let’s break this down. We have a 45-year-old man here, who suddenly starts showing some pretty specific symptoms: dysarthria, shuffling gait, and those intention tremors. This suggests something's going wrong with motor control, probably involving the cerebellum or its connections.\\n\\nNow, what's intriguing is that he's had a history of alcohol use, but he's been off it for the past 10 years. Alcohol can do a number on the cerebellum, leading to degeneration, and apparently, the effects can hang around or even appear long after one stops drinking.\\n\\nAt first glance, these symptoms look like they could be some kind of chronic degeneration, maybe something like alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, but hold on. This looks different. The symptoms just came on all of a sudden. Chronic degenerations typically have a more gradual onset.\\n\\nOkay, let’s reconsider this sudden nature. It’s making me think of something more acute, more rapid onset. Hmm, if we dig back into his history of drinking, there might have been some damage done, leading to nutritional deficiencies, like a lack of thiamine.\\n\\nWernicke’s encephalopathy is a classic possibility here. That condition pops up due to thiamine deficiency, often after a history of alcohol use. It’s known for causing ataxia, confusion, and eye movement issues. However, he’s not showing the full triad of symptoms; there's no mention of confusion or eye problems, so maybe it doesn’t fit perfectly.\\n\\nOh, wait a second, maybe we're missing something simpler. Given the acute nature of the symptoms, maybe this is more in line with something like a stroke. Sudden onset can definitely suggest a vascular event. With his alcohol history, he’s at risk for things like high blood pressure, which can increase stroke risk.\\n\\nIn particular, lacunar strokes can mess with motor coordination, speech, the works. These are small, but significant enough to cause these exact symptoms: dysarthria, tremors, and a shuffling gait.\\n\\nBut hang on, what if there’s another angle we’re missing? Chronic alcohol effects might still play a role here, just in a different way. There’s a condition called acquired hepatocerebral degeneration. This can happen in people with a history of liver disease due to alcohol, even years after they’ve quit. It can result in symptoms like these because of how substances get deposited in the brain.\\n\\nLinking this back to our patient, his history with alcohol could’ve led to some liver issues, and now, here we are with these symptoms showing up suddenly. Makes sense, right? So, considering everything, acquired hepatocerebral degeneration seems to fit quite nicely. That’s probably our most fitting diagnosis for this situation.\",\n 'Response': \"Considering the clinical presentation of sudden onset dysarthria, shuffling gait, and intention tremors in a 45-year-old man with a history of alcohol use who has been abstinent for the past 10 years, the most likely diagnosis is acquired hepatocerebral degeneration.\\n\\nThis condition is associated with chronic liver disease, which can often be a consequence of long-term alcohol use.

Based on these findings, what would cystometry most likely reveal about her residual volume and detrusor contractions?\\n\\n### Response:\\n<think>\\nOkay, let's think about this step by step. There's a 61-year-old woman here who's been dealing with involuntary urine leakages whenever she's doing something that ups her abdominal pressure like coughing or sneezing. This sounds a lot like stress urinary incontinence to me. Now, it's interesting that she doesn't have any issues at night; she isn't experiencing leakage while sleeping. This likely means her bladder's ability to hold urine is fine when she isn't under physical stress. Hmm, that's a clue that we're dealing with something related to pressure rather than a bladder muscle problem. \\n\\nThe fact that she underwent a Q-tip test is intriguing too. This test is usually done to assess urethral mobility. In stress incontinence, a Q-tip might move significantly, showing urethral hypermobility. This kind of movement often means there's a weakness in the support structures that should help keep the urethra closed during increases in abdominal pressure. So, that's aligning well with stress incontinence.\\n\\nNow, let's think about what would happen during cystometry. Since stress incontinence isn't usually about sudden bladder contractions, I wouldn't expect to see involuntary detrusor contractions during this test. Her bladder isn't spasming or anything; it's more about the support structure failing under stress. Plus, she likely empties her bladder completely because stress incontinence doesn't typically involve incomplete emptying. So, her residual volume should be pretty normal. \\n\\nAll in all, it seems like if they do a cystometry on her, it will likely show a normal residual volume and no involuntary contractions. Yup, I think that makes sense given her symptoms and the typical presentations of stress urinary incontinence.\\n</think>\\nCystometry in this case of stress urinary incontinence would most likely reveal a normal post-void residual volume, as stress incontinence typically does not involve issues with bladder emptying. Additionally, since stress urinary incontinence is primarily related to physical exertion and not an overactive bladder, you would not expect to see any involuntary detrusor contractions during the test.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\""},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":18},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Apply LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning to the model \nmodel_lora = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(\n    model,\n    r=16,  # LoRA rank: Determines the size of the trainable adapters (higher = more parameters, lower = more efficiency)\n    target_modules=[  # List of transformer layers where LoRA adapters will be applied\n        \"q_proj\",   # Query projection in the self-attention mechanism\n        \"k_proj\",   # Key projection in the self-attention mechanism\n        \"v_proj\",   # Value projection in the self-attention mechanism\n        \"o_proj\",   # Output projection from the attention layer\n        \"gate_proj\",  # Used in feed-forward layers (MLP)\n        \"up_proj\",    # Part of the transformer’s feed-forward network (FFN)\n        \"down_proj\",  # Another part of the transformer’s FFN\n    ],\n    lora_alpha=16,  # Scaling factor for LoRA updates (higher values allow more influence from LoRA layers)\n    lora_dropout=0,  # Dropout rate for LoRA layers (0 means no dropout, full retention of information)\n    bias=\"none\",  # Specifies whether LoRA layers should learn bias terms (setting to \"none\" saves memory)\n    use_gradient_checkpointing=\"unsloth\",  # Saves memory by recomputing activations instead of storing them (recommended for long-context fine-tuning)\n    random_state=3407,  # Sets a seed for reproducibility, ensuring the same fine-tuning behavior across runs\n    use_rslora=False,  # Whether to use Rank-Stabilized LoRA (disabled here, meaning fixed-rank LoRA is used)\n    loftq_config=None,  # Low-bit Fine-Tuning Quantization (LoFTQ) is disabled in this configuration\n)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-19T03:10:05.430582Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-19T03:10:05.430833Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-19T03:10:12.381208Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-19T03:10:05.430816Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-19T03:10:12.380615Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"Unsloth 2025.3.19 patched 32 layers with 32 QKV layers, 32 O layers and 32 MLP layers.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":19},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Initialize the fine-tuning trainer — Imported using from trl import SFTTrainer\ntrainer = SFTTrainer(\n    model=model_lora,  # The model to be fine-tuned\n    tokenizer=tokenizer,  # Tokenizer to process text inputs\n    train_dataset=dataset_finetune,  # Dataset used for training\n    dataset_text_field=\"text\",  # Specifies which field in the dataset contains training text\n    max_seq_length=max_seq_length,  # Defines the maximum sequence length for inputs\n    dataset_num_proc=2,  # Uses 2 CPU threads to speed up data preprocessing\n\n    # Define training arguments\n    args=TrainingArguments(\n        per_device_train_batch_size=2,  # Number of examples processed per device (GPU) at a time\n        gradient_accumulation_steps=4,  # Accumulate gradients over 4 steps before updating weights\n        num_train_epochs=1, # Full fine-tuning run\n        warmup_steps=5,  # Gradually increases learning rate for the first 5 steps\n        max_steps=60,  # Limits training to 60 steps (useful for debugging; increase for full fine-tuning)\n        learning_rate=2e-4,  # Learning rate for weight updates (tuned for LoRA fine-tuning)\n        fp16=not is_bfloat16_supported(),  # Use FP16 (if BF16 is not supported) to speed up training\n        bf16=is_bfloat16_supported(),  # Use BF16 if supported (better numerical stability on newer GPUs)\n        logging_steps=10,  # Logs training progress every 10 steps\n        optim=\"adamw_8bit\",  # Uses memory-efficient AdamW optimizer in 8-bit mode\n        weight_decay=0.01,  # Regularization to prevent overfitting\n        lr_scheduler_type=\"linear\",  # Uses a linear learning rate schedule\n        seed=3407,  # Sets a fixed seed for reproducibility\n        output_dir=\"outputs\",  # Directory where fine-tuned model checkpoints will be saved\n    ),\n)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-19T03:10:24.074579Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-19T03:10:24.075343Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-19T03:10:27.018915Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-19T03:10:24.075312Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-19T03:10:27.018123Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Unsloth: Tokenizing [\"text\"] (num_proc=2):   0%|          | 0/500 [00:00<?, ?

We have a 61-year-old woman who's been dealing with involuntary urine loss during things like coughing or sneezing, but she's not losing any urine at night. That sounds like a classic case of urge incontinence, right? \n\nNow, when she underwent a Q-tip test, what did they find? The Q-tip test is used to check for urethral obstruction. If there's obstruction, the urethra might not open easily, and the test can detect that by measuring the pressure needed to open it. If the pressure is high, it suggests obstruction. \n\nBut let's not jump to conclusions yet. We need to think about what this means for her bladder. If there's obstruction, it can affect how her bladder behaves. In cases of urethral obstruction, the bladder can become hyperreflexic, meaning it might contract more easily than usual. \n\nNow, what happens when the bladder contracts? Well, if it's hyperreflexic, it can contract more often, which can lead to increased urge to urinate. That makes sense with what she's experiencing—she loses urine involuntarily during activities. \n\nBut what about her residual volume? Residual volume is how much urine she can hold without leaking. If her bladder's hyperreflexic, it might not hold as much as usual. That could mean her residual volume is low. \n\nOh, and what about the detrusor contractions? Since she's having more frequent and stronger contractions, it's likely that the detrusor contractions are more forceful than normal. \n\nSo, putting it all together, if there's urethral obstruction causing her bladder to be hyperreflexic, we'd expect her to have a low residual volume and more forceful detrusor contractions. That seems to fit with what we know about her symptoms. \n\nYeah, that all makes sense. I think we've got it figured out now. The cystometry would likely show a low residual volume and more forceful detrusor contractions.\n</think>\nBased on the findings from the Q-tip test and the symptoms described, cystometry would most likely reveal that the patient has a low residual volume and more forceful detrusor contractions.

They can be pretty aggressive, especially if they're in the bloodstream. That's a big red flag for something like infective endocarditis. \n\nNow, let's think about what causes infective endocarditis. It's often due to certain conditions that allow bacteria to get into the bloodstream. This includes things like having a heart valve that's already damaged, which could be from something like hypertension or atherosclerosis. \n\nOh, and there's also something about having a prosthetic valve. If someone has a heart valve replacement, that can definitely put them at a higher risk for infections because the artificial valve might have a foreign body that's more prone to bacterial colonization. \n\nHmm, this guy's got a 12 mm vegetation. That's pretty big, and it's on the aortic valve. So, I'm starting to think that maybe he has a prosthetic valve there. If that's the case, it's a classic scenario for infective endocarditis, especially with these streptococci that are known to be pretty virulent. \n\nYeah, I think this is pointing towards a prosthetic valve as the main culprit. It's definitely a known risk factor for these types of infections. So, putting it all together, I'd say the most likely predisposing factor here is the presence of a prosthetic aortic valve.\n</think>\nThe most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition is the presence of a prosthetic aortic valve. This is a known risk factor for infective endocarditis, especially when combined with the presence of a vegetation on the aortic valve and the virulent nature of the gram-positive, gamma-hemolytic cocci identified in the blood cultures.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":24},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
